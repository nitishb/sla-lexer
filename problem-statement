PROBLEM STATEMENT


Lexical Analyzer for XML Files. 


Given an sla document (sla is the file format of Scribus, which is XML), extract all the text contents (Embedded using ITEXT tag) removing all tags and save it as a text file.

SLA file format specification : http://wiki.scribus.net/index.php/File_Format_Specification_for_Scribus_1.4

Programming Language : Python

Additional Information :-

* The .sla file given as input to the application contains no errors. This is because the file is not manually written, but is generated by Scribus. But for testing purpose, a simple error reporter is also encorporated.



How to run the program:-

itextextractor.py file creates a text file output that contains the text contents extracted from the .sla input file. It also prints the contents on the screen. 

The python script to run this is 
	python itextextractor.py test.sla

Output will be printed on the screen and also written to a text file output.


lexer.py prints the token stream of the input file.

The python script to run this is
	python lexer.py abc

Output will be displayed on the screen. 

Outputs can be verified by comparing with the input sla file.
